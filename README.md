# Online Library Management System

## Overview
This project is a MySQL-based database for managing a library system. It tracks books, borrowers, loans, and fines using a relational schema with foreign keys, constraints, and triggers. The project demonstrates proficiency in database design, CRUD operations, and advanced SQL queries (joins, aggregations, updates). Itâ€™s designed as a portfolio piece to showcase MySQL skills for potential employers.

## Features
- **Relational Schema**: Tables for `Books`, `Borrowers`, `Loans`, and `Fines` with appropriate primary and foreign key constraints.
- **Sample Data**: Populated with realistic data (10+ books and borrowers, multiple loans and fines).
- **SQL Queries**: Examples include listing available books, identifying overdue loans, and calculating total fines per borrower.
- **Constraints**: Enforces rules like `DueDate > LoanDate` and allows `NULL` for `ReturnDate` for unreturned books.

## Technologies
- MySQL (version 5.6 or later)
- MySQL Workbench (optional, for visualization)

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Library-Management-System.git`
2. Create the database: Run `schema.sql` in MySQL Workbench or a MySQL client.
3. Populate the tables: Execute `sample_data.sql` to insert sample data.
4. Run queries: Use `queries.sql` to explore the database with example queries.

## File Structure
- `schema.sql`: Creates the database and tables with constraints.
- `sample_data.sql`: Inserts sample data for books, borrowers, loans, and fines.
- `queries.sql`: Contains example SQL queries for common tasks.
- `docs/`: (Optional) ER diagrams or screenshots.

## Example Queries
1. **List Available Books**:
   ```sql
   SELECT Title, Author, AvailableCopies
   FROM Books
   WHERE AvailableCopies > 0;
